Spring Boot Echo Example
-------------------
A small app that echoes back a nice JSON with some info from the incoming requests:
- Request protocol
- Request method  
- Request headers
- Request cookies
- Request params (query string)
- Request path
- Request body (Base64 encoded)

Is is usefull to trace/debug problems while developing REST APIs and SOAP WebServices.  

# Features:
0. Just under java 9
1. Spring Boot 1.3.7, supporting fully executable JARs for Linux based operating systems, including “service” support
2. Accepts HTTP methods:  GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and OPTIONS
3. Accepts all content type (\*/\*)
4. Catches everything (ie, mapped at /**), thus no webjars,  no favicon.ico and no /error 
5. Response code is always a 404 "Not Found" to avoid unexpected client behavior
6. GZip compression is disabled (on purpose) to avoid unexpected client behavior
7. Response content type is always "application/json;charset=UTF-8".
8. Only 1 class, about 50 lines of code!!! 
9. Small. Final JAR includes everything (it self-contained) and it is only 12 MB

# Try it using your browser, REST client, SoapUI, with:
* http://localhost:8080/sample.asp?product=42&category=dummy
* http://localhost:8080/sample.php?name=john
* http://localhost:8080/sample.html
* http://localhost:8080/sample.json
* http://localhost:8080/sample.css
* http://localhost:8080/sample.js
* http://localhost:8080/ws/sample.wsdl
* http://localhost:8080/people/1/cars

Use your preferred IDE such as SpringSource Tool Suite (STS) or IDEA:
